    <p>My name is Rashida Mohammed Bappare I was born on the 5 may 1998, in yola south local government of adamawa state at a beautiful, lovely and happy family. I was born at shagari health clinic yola  adamawa state. At the age of 7 i enrolled into muhammadu mai mai morial primary school wuro hausa where i obtained my FSLC, During my study in that primary school i won an award for perfect attendance.
I had my elementary Islamic education from my parents and  relatives . then I travelled to other places including within shagari for my advance studies one of my teacher was the famous Nuruddeen Badamasi who had a remakerble influence on me.
I was extra ordinary well read in Arabic literature i was a master of the classical tongue which i had learn in my youth. 
Iam 22yrs  old now, my tribe is Fulani kilba , and my religion is islam. My best food is indome and egg, my best color is pink, white, blue, yellow and red. I was born and raised in the heart of adamawa state and grew up a very out going and active child. My family is notatable in our locality it is known as Bappare’s family, Bappare is my grand father  he is well known in that society be cause he is very humble and educated Islamic scholar, that has made him to be a very respected man in that locality.  he has 4 wives 47 children, my lovely gentle daddy Dr mohammed Bappare  who happened to be one of his son’s is also blessed and well known. Dr Mohammed Bappare  My first class gentle  father he is a very nice, kind, humble,  and lovely man but sometimes he is very hash, he is very  educated especially in the medical field. He is a medical practitional ss he help a lot of people in our society may Allah grant him long life. My father meet with my beautiful queen mother at hong local government, my father use to tell us that apart from his mother  he loves our beautiful mother Aeesha more than any woman in this world. My late beautiful mummy Aisha  queen of all mothers in Africa she is very very beautiful and nice every child pray to have a mother like her. she is medium in size, she is white in color, she has bold eyes, round face, pink lips, long hair, in short my dear gentle teacher dee-dee my mummy she is extremely beautiful woman. She has 14yrs she got marriage with our daddy. And she gives birth to 7 children 4 men, 3 ladies iam one of her children and iam the number 7. Iam beautiful, simple and obedient lady, after completed my primary school in 2006, then  I further my education to school for Arabic and Islamic studies yola where I obtained my 6 years education both junior and senior, during my education in that school I also won award for perfect attendance and two for being name student of the year. 
I fall in love at a very early age of 13-14 during this time iam in jss 2 his name is abdullahi he is from kaduna state makarfi lg work brought him adamawa he is a dr he is working with federal medical center yola, he loves me so much and me too I love abdullahi so much we even exchange our name, we use to call each other with the name [Abrash] means Abdullahi and Rashida. He also put me promise ring in my finger, me to I put it for him we promise to each other even death we will never allowed it to separate us, he gives me a call more than ten times in a day. i love abrash more than how I loves my self, because I fell his love in my blood, bones, veins, heart and soul i can imaging life without him. Life with out abrash is just like a car without driver…
but and the end our parents refuse to allowed us to get married, destiny kill us, kills my dreams, kill my love. my father said he will not gives hausa man his daughter and kaduna is too far, I cry i cry to the extend that i fell to kill my self, i pray, i beg Allah, never allowed them to toke abrash love of my life the reasons of my existing out away from my life, but God didn’t answer my prayer they separed us, when someone you love becomes a memory, the memory becomes a treasure. No words can explain the sadness in the deplish of my soul,   I have oready die years ago because my soul is with abdullahi my parent have my body only… from there i pack anything about love aside i continue with my study, I never fall in love again until i was in ss 2 i  meet another guy he is goal keeper his name is Muhammad sanusi he loves me but me i just accept him because of my condition we keep going time did not leave anything, I fall in his love so much, we design our marriage home, our future children, he promise me he will send his parent to our house to seek my marriage after he came back from Abuja, glory be to God he travel and come back, so he tell his parent about our love and he want them to go and seek marriage for him, hmhm can you imaging sir destiny come for the second time his father tell him sorry he keep a girl for him long time. 
Tears fall down from my eyes and i said o Load why always me? If come about love iam i the only unluckiest lady in the word? Why my life always full of pain, hurt, and disappointment? from that day  I said i give up on love,  and I will never give any man opportunity ticket in my life again. 
I write my ssce in 15 I want to further my education after receiving my result but my father refurse to allowed me  so i wasted 2 years in home while my class mate in school for Arabic and Islamic studies yola majority of them further there education and they get there diploma certificate. So i go back to islamiyya at father rahman yola where I continue with islamic education I start from class of qur’an and memorization I spend one year in that islamiya, befor I ask my brother Bappare to ask our father to allowed me to my education even in legal iam very lucky he allowed, when I was young my dream is to learn micro biology but now I have no option because they have oredy kill all my dreams.
WHO IS MY ONE AND ONLY SWEET BROTHER IN MY JOURNY LIFE
One of the best relationship between a sister and a brother or  brother to brother no matter what a brother was always be there for you. The relationship that is there between siblings is so streaming and should never be assumed.
If you have a biggest brother it’s always good to appreciate them in every day.
Life never gives me so many opportunities, but it gave me a brother who made me see those opportunities my brother Bappare he is the best ever.
  THE SADDEST PART OF MY LIFE
My mother died 11 years ago on 8 may 2009
Life consists of losses, the loss of a child, opportunity loss, financial loss, relational loss, physical loss. Every day we lose a day of life. But one of the most significant is the loss of someone who is dearly loved. When momma died a part of me died. How can a mother love ever be replaced? The one whose body i come out of lies horizontal 6 feet in the earth.
Never to verbally communicate her care for me again. My momma is gone and that still makes me sad.
WHAT LIFE MEAN TO ME RASHEEDAT
Life is that feeling you get after cleaning out your room to perfection. Life is realizing that not every one in our lives is meant to stay and understanding that the important one’s will remain in the long run.
Life is having a little bit of faith that e
verything has a purpose, and we will all be okey in the end.
MY GOALS IN LIFE
I will look for opportunities to speak in front of the class to gain self confidence. i will raise my hand up when teacher ask for answer from the class, measurable by the end of the weak I will raise my hand at least five times to answers the questions.
MY OUT LOOK ON THE FUTURE
Life can only be understanding backwards but it must be liked forward; the future belongs to those who believe on the beauty of their dreams. 
If you need to be happy do not look in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on looking in the present.
MY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS IN LIFE 
My strength is I’m an honest, hardworking lady with a positive attitude, I’m good at social intercourse. I can communicate well with others people. Also I’m flexible.
My weakness is shyness I find it intimidating to ask questions or raise point, so I have often remained quiet in the class. My second weakness is too patient, too honest and I can’t say no if any person ask me for help. And I  easily believe every one and my inability to say “NO” when some need my help.
MY DREAM IN LIFE
My dream life is to meet great people
My dream life is to travel
My dream life is to move across the world and live in different countries
My dream life is to discover new passions
My dream life is to become aware
My dream life is to be able to cry, breakdown with no reason and not to be judge by the people I trust
My dream life is to be unconditionaly love by my close one’s
My dream life is to spend as much quality times as I can with my family
My dream life is to keep learning and evolving for ever
My dream life is to have a healthy body that lets me experience life
My dream life is to have mentors who’s support me,  advice me and help me move forward
My dream life is to be brave enough to be vulnerable
My dream life is to learn how to let go…..
